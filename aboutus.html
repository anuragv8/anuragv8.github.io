    <p>We started in 1992, with a small group of young children.<br><br>
      Strict time schedules, deadlines, interactions restricted to only recesses,
      textbook knowledge with little or no exploration, every child on the same page
     in a teacher driven classroom, limited recognition of individual potential, rote learning,
    pressure of examinations, loads of homework…where was the fun of early childhood that is meant
    to explore and learn, thus developing a lifelong love for learning? We need to bring them
     out of the rigid layers of learning that exist in our society.<br><br>
     The Montessori Method of education is increasingly gaining momentum in our country.
    People are becoming more aware of the folly of depriving a young child of rich and fun
    learning experiences.<br><br>
    Every child has a unique potential and personality that needs to be nurtured in the first six
    years of life. The Montessori system recognises each child’s individuality,
    thus guiding to reach unique levels of physical, emotional, spiritual and intellectual
     development. Learning becomes fun and exploration becomes the key to everything.
     The beauty of education comes alive through a natural love to learn all things meaningful
     and purposeful.</p>

      <p class="FounderText">Mrs Sipra Narayanan did the AMI course in 1982 under the direct guidance and training of Mr Joosten and Mr Swamy who were taught by Dr Montessori herself. Thereafter she taught in traditional schools having acquired a Master’s degree in Education. Before beginning Touch Internationale, she was a lecturer at the Sophia’s Teachers Training College in Bangalore. Those years spent in traditional schools strengthened her determination to start a Montessori House as she observed how difficult it was for children to enjoy school and the learning process.<br><br>
In 1992 she started Touch Internationale in a small house with all of four children. She had a carpenter break the solid wooden army boxes acquired during transfers when her husband was with the Indian Army into tables and shelves for the Montessori environment. Those were the humble beginnings of Touch Internationale 25 years back.
<br><br>At that time, the Montessori system was ambiguous to many and it was a daunting task educating people about the benefits of the method.  Her motto today remains, “Nothing is impossible that the human being cannot put his talent and effort to make happen.”
Indrakshi Narayanan shares her mother’s passion for all things Montessori. After completing her AMI Primary Course for 3-6 year olds, she too brings her experience and passion into the environment working with the children.

    <p class="baandekTitle">SPOTLIGHT: TOUCH INTERNATIONALE MONTESSORI SCHOOL</p>


    <p class="baandekText">We have over the last 7 years had children with special needs approach us through their doctors and psychologists for a Montessori intervention in their learning. And it has been found beneficial with marked improvements. Mrs Narayanan always felt that keeping aside the Montessori method, a teacher has very little credit to herself when the child who succeeds is an intelligent one, but the credit truly goes to her if she can make a difference in the life of a slow learner or someone with special needs. With the help of the method, we have had great success with children who come in the early stages as border line cases for autism, slow learning, delayed speech, etc. We work along with their doctors and speech therapists.
      <br><br>One such 2.5 yr old autistic child joined us a month ago with very distraught parents saying that she is very withdrawn and does not communicate with anyone and instead seems to be in her own world. We included her in the regular environment and last week the special educator signalled me to observe what she was doing. She was sitting with the world map and pronouncing to the best of her ability the names of the continents!!! All because she had seen other children in the environment working with the same material. That was the hidden intellect and grasping power of a child who may not have had that chance if it wasn’t for Montessori. Her parents who observed this later had tears in their eyes. It was a very emotional “Montessori Moment.”
